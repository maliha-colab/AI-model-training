# AI-Model-Training

## Overview
This project contains a Google Colab notebook and Python script for training an AI model on a dataset. It demonstrates end-to-end steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Files Included
- `model_training.ipynb` – Colab notebook with code, outputs and explanations (preferred for walkthroughs)
- `model_training.py` – Python script with clean, execution-ready code version

## Notebook Highlights
- **Dataset preparation**: data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding
- **Model building**: baseline model implementation using scikit-learn
- **Training & evaluation**: model training, performance metrics (accuracy, loss), and evaluation plots
- **Results**: quick display of model performance and observations

## How to Use
1. Open `model_training.ipynb` in Google Colab:

2. For clean execution, run:
   ```bash
   python model_training.py
